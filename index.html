           <h3>Yet another Techy Guy !<br><br></h3>

           <p>Hey ! This is Ronak Bothra, a 2nd year CSE B.tech student from Dronacharya College of Engineering, Gurgaon. Well talking about myself, i grew up in a small town of Bilasipara in Assam. Since childhood, I was a silent kid and a good observor of the things going around me.
               It was the time when I had folders of the songs of my favourite singers XD. I am fond of cricket, football, carrom, chess, badminton. Those were good old days when the word "PRESSURE" didnt existed in my dictionary. <br><br> I used to watch a lot of cartoons and played cricket all day long until 10th. After that, life took a turn and I turned my focus to clear JEE from 11th. As ill luck would have it , Just cleared the cutoff. Now, its the college life. During the first year, explored all the fields from which we can shape our career in future. I dived deeper listeninig to different genres of songs. As the 1st year went online, I came to know about discord and it was the best thing which happened to me during that time. I guess our batch is the first ever batch to have made friends online.</p>
